# no_working
- This project not working
- Until the project is a working, this section will live here
- Don't wait release - there may not be one

# core
In this repository I will write code from which I will build games

I will use Russian in comments and commits,
but in the files (except documentation, etc.) I will use more English.

My standard:
- The tab will consist of two spaces // I don't know why
- I chose [–°++](https://github.com/topics/cpp) as my programming language // It's easier for me to program with it.
- More information will be given in the file [STYLE.md](DOC/STYLE.md)

# info
This will be the engine (a set of libraries-parts for the game)

In engine you find:
- [data types](type/README.md) (–Ω–µ–ø–æ—Å—Ä–µ–¥—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–æ –∏–∑-–∑–∞ —É–Ω–∏–∫–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏ [–°++](https://github.com/topics/cpp))
- [game objects](lib/README.md) –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä—ã–µ –Ω–∞—Å–ª–µ–¥—É—é—Ç—Å—è –æ—Ç [Object](lib/object.hpp)
- other auxiliary temporary [tools](tools/README.md)

If you find something you can fix: Write! cytoncode@gmail.com or here

# game-
- I want to make a game similar to Orion Online, Project Galaxy, Minecraft (or rather, the engine based on them and after the game itself).
- I created this repository as a pure [game-](https://github.com/CyTon-Code/game-) repo list.
- After all, I have a habit of cluttering up everything I do ...
- So I will try to drag everything I need from [game-](https://github.com/CyTon-Code/game-) here.
- At the same time, I will try to describe each line of code in as much detail as possible
