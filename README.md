# core
In this repository I will write code from which I will build games

I will use Russian in comments and commits,
but in the files (except documentation, etc.) I will use more English.

My standard:
- The tab will consist of two spaces // I don't know why
- I chose [Ð¡++](https://github.com/topics/cpp) as my programming language // It's easier for me to program with it.
- More information will be given in the file [STYLE.md](DOC/STYLE.md)
