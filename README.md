# README

This README is available in:
[🇷🇺](README_RU.md)

# no_working
- This project not working
- Until the project is a working, this section will live here
- Don't wait release - there may not be one

# core
In this repository I will write code from which I will build games

I will use Russian in comments and commits,
but in the files (except documentation, etc.) I will use more English.

My standard:
- The tab will consist of two spaces // I don't know why
- I chose [С++](https://github.com/topics/cpp) as my programming language // It's easier for me to program with it.
- More information will be given in the file [STYLE.md](DOC/STYLE.md)

# info
This will be the engine (a set of libraries-parts for the game)

In engine you find:
- [data types](type/README.md) (непосредственно из-за уникальности [С++](https://github.com/topics/cpp))
- [game objects](lib/README.md) которые наследуются от [Object](lib/object.hpp)
- other auxiliary temporary [tools](tools/README.md)

If you find something you can fix: Write! cytoncode@gmail.com or here

# game-
- I want to make a game similar to Orion Online, Project Galaxy, Minecraft (or rather, the engine based on them and after the game itself).
- core репозиторий я создал как чистый лист репо [game-](https://github.com/CyTon-Code/game-)
- Ведь у меня есть привычка приблежать все к состоянию свалки ...
- Поэтому я попытаюсь сюда перетащить все необходимое из [game-](https://github.com/CyTon-Code/game-)
- Попутно постараюсь максимально подробно описать об каждой строчке
